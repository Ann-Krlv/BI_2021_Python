# Homework to 2022.02.15 (classes in Python)

The folder contains jupyter notebook and script 'classes.py' with the same code.
4 classes are created in these files (4 tasks marked in the notebook).

The python code needs some libs for correct working:
* numpy
* seaborn
* matplotlib
* Bio

All the names of the required libraries are in the file 'requirements.txt', so you can run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install them.
(it is better to use virtual environment)

The code correct works with Python 3.8, on Ubuntu 20.4.
